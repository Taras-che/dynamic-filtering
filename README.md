# DynamicFiltering

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.7.

1. Run `npm install` in the terminal inside the project folder
2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Developer Notes
The project is made in Angular 15 because I have limited familiarity with the syntax of version 17, and it could slow me down. The main goal I set for myself is to create a reusable table with dynamic columns and filters to standardize usage for various tasks. I am not satisfied with the search because there is an issue with searching across different columns. Currently, this search is not dynamic. I plan to fix this after a certain time, just for myself.
