# DynamicFiltering

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.7.

1. Run `npm install` in the terminal inside the project folder
2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Developer Notes

I know that markup is not perfect, but my goal was to create a shared table that can be used in any part of a project.
Search, filter, and sort through any column you need - just set up the configuration for columns.
